### 🐺 About me
I'm **Creeperlulu** (but you can call me Epson - it's my fursona's name).  
**17 years old**, french **furry** (protogen) and **soon to be student at Epitech**.  
I enjoy **coding** from time to time (although I don't really have time at the moment).  
I like **computers** and IT in general.  
I'm also part of the **Scpija** team.

I use **Windows** but I'm starting to get on Arch Linux.  
I already coded a bit in Java, C, C#, Python, and HTML/CSS.  
For now I'm a **Visual Studio Code** user.

### 💻 My current projects
- 📱 Oasis OS, a mobile operating system based off the Android Open Source Project
- 🎮 A demake of a PC rythm game for the Nintendo 3DS
- 🌐 My personal website

### 🔧 Languages, tools, and software I already used (at least once)
